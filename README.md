# üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Automated Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-Rays

This project presents a robust computer vision solution for the automated detection of pneumonia using chest X-ray images. Leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the solution classifies X-ray images as 'NORMAL' or 'PNEUMONIA', aiming to assist medical professionals in rapid and accurate diagnosis.

## üèÉ How to Run the Project (Local Setup)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/AbdullahRandhawa/Pneumonia-Classification-Using-CNN-TransferLearning.git](https://github.com/AbdullahRandhawa/Pneumonia-Classification-Using-CNN-TransferLearning.git)
    cd Pneumonia-Classification-Using-CNN-TransferLearning
    ```
2.  **Install Git LFS (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    git lfs install
    ```
3.  **Ensure Git LFS is tracking model files:**
    ```bash
    git lfs track "*.h5"
    git lfs track "*.keras"
    ```
    *(These commands only need to be run once per repository. The `.gitattributes` file should already be committed.)*
4.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    It's recommended to use a virtual environment.
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

    # pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5.  **Download the Dataset:**
    * Download the "Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)" dataset from Kaggle via the link above.
    * Extract the contents into a directory (e.g., `chest_xray`) within your project folder, ensuring the `train`, `test`, and `val` folders are correctly structured (`train/NORMAL`, `train/PNEUMONIA`, etc.).
6.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    * Open the `Pneumonia Classification CNN Transfer Learning.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
